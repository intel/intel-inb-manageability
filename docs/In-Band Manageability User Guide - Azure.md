## Introduction

### Audience

This guide is intended for

-   Independent BIOS Vendors providing Firmware Update packages to
    ensure FW update binary packaging.

-   Independent Software Vendors (ISV) providing OS and Application
    update packages.

-   System Integrators administrating devices running the Intel® In-Band
    Manageability framework.

## Azure&reg; Overview

### Getting Started with Azure&reg;


Creating an Azure&reg; account and obtaining the connection tokens from
Azure&reg; is required for provisioning or enabling Over-the-Air updates.
For reference and quick setup, you will also need to import INB’s IoT
Central Application which will provide the same UI interface described
in this document to monitor the device and perform OTA commands.

This section will walk through the setup steps:

-   Creating Azure&reg; portal account

-   Setting up an Azure&reg; IoT Central Application

-   Accessing Azure&reg; portal account

-   Setting up the application for X509 based device enrollment

#### Creating Azure&reg; portal account

In order to setup an Azure&reg; account, follow the steps below:

-   If not done already, an Azure&reg; account can be created through the
    link below:  
    <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/>

#### Setting up an Azure&reg; IoT Central Application 

-   To use the reference Intel® In-Band Manageability Framework IoT Central application, use the link mentioned within the following path.

```
/usr/share/cloudadapter-agent/azure_template_link.txt
```

-   Log in with an Azure&reg; Account when prompted.

-   The following form will appear

    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image4.png" style="width:4.84028in;height:4.77014in" />

-   Fill out the form accordingly, then click **Create.**

    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image3.png" style="width:4.82431in;height:1.12778in" />

-   After provisioning, the IoT Central application with premade device templates and dashboards will appear. As noted before, this can be accessed at 
    <https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/> under *My Apps* tab or through the Azure&reg; portal.

#### Accessing Azure&reg;

-   Azure&reg; portal can be accessed at:  
    <https://portal.azure.com/#home>

-   If an Azure&reg; IoT Central has already been set up, it can be
    accessed at:  
    <https://apps.azureiotcentral.com>

-   Otherwise, follow next step to set up an IoT Central application

#### Setting up the application for X509 based device enrollment

The following Dashboard screen appears once the application is created.
The user can enroll for a X509 based enrollment group to enroll the
intermediate or root CA signed certificate, to authenticate the device
further by using the X509 authentication mechanism.

This step is necessary only if the user requires the X509 authentication
on the devices, else this step can be ignored.

-   To create an Enrollment Group, click **Administration** \[**A**\], **Device
Connection** \[**B**\], **Create enrollment group** \[**C**\] as seen in the image below.

<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image5.png" style="width:5.99167in;height:2.43194in" />

Upon the display of the form as seen in the above image.
1.  Fill in the Enrollment group name.

2.  Select **Attestation type** as *Certificates (X509)*.

3.  Click**Save**.

<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image6.png" style="width:5.99167in;height:5.78403in" />

Once the group is saved, the user needs to upload root or intermediate
certificate as shown in Figure 5:

1.  Click **Manage Primary**.

2.  Select the folder button as show below. This opens a window where
    user chooses the certificate from the currently operated user
    device.

<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image7.png" style="width:5.99167in;height:5.52778in" />

3. After uploading the certificate, click **Generate verification code** as seen below.
<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image8.png" style="width:6in;height:5.48819in" />

After the verification code is populated in the text box adjacent to the
**Generate verification code** button, the user needs to use this
verification code to generate a verification certificate which will
later be uploaded after clicking the **Verify** button in the form shown
in Figure 6.

<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image9.png" style="width:5.99167in;height:5.53611in" />

Once the verification is done by the portal, the following screen displays
stating verification is successful. Next, click **Close** button to
close the form.

### Creating a Device and Obtaining Device Credentials


To connect a device to the Azure&reg; portal, a device needs to be created
first on the portal with the template that the user wishes to associate
the device with. The device created will have a name and an
auto-generated device-id, device-scope-id, and a shared access primary
key, which will be later used on the user’s device, while provisioning
the device to Azure&reg; cloud.

-   When accessing the dashboard for the IoT Central application, the following
    screen will appear. In **Devices** tab **A**, select Template (**Intel
    Manageability**) **B** and click **New** **C**. 

    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image10.png" style="width:6in;height:1.60972in" />

-   A new device registration form appears as shown in Figure 9. Fill in the
    **DeviceID** and **Device Name** information and click **Create**.

    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image11.png" style="width:3.56181in;height:3.05347in" />

-   The newly created device will appear on the Dashboard with the specified Device Name. Click the device created, the status will be shown as *Registerer*. Then, click **Connect** as seen below.

    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image12.png" style="width:5.99167in;height:0.68819in" />

-   As INB supports both SAS and X509 authentication types, the user must choose one of the Authentication types supported. If the user intends to select SAS based authentication, refer to [Shared Access Signature (SAS) authentication](#shared_access_signaturesas_authentication). Else, if the user wants X509 based Authentication, refer to [X509 Authentication](#x509_authentication).<span id="_2.3.1_Shared_Access" class="anchor"></span>

#### Shared Access Signature (SAS) authentication:

-   By clicking the ‘Connect’ button shown in Figure 5, in the dialog that appears, **<span class="underline">note</span>** the **Scope ID \[A\]**, **Device ID \[B\]**, and **Shared Access Key(SAS) \[C\]**, as these information will be used to provision the device as depicted:

    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image13.png" style="width:4.37008in;height:4.66561in" />

#### X509 authentication:

>**Note:** To authenticate a device using X509 mechanism, a X509 based
> enrollment group needs to be created with CA signed root or
> intermediate certificates. The verification of the private key
> possession needs to be done as shown in [Setting up the application for X509 based device enrollment](#setting-up-the-application-for-x509-based-device-enrollment).

-   The user needs to generate a primary and secondary device certificates using the root or intermediate certificate used to enroll in [Setting up the application for X509 based device enrollment](#setting-up-the-application-for-x509-based-device-enrollment).

-   Once the device certs are generated, visit the Azure&reg; portal, select the device created earlier. Then click the **Connect** button. In the dialog that appears,     note the **Scope ID and Device ID \[A\]** as the information will be used to provision the device. Next, select Authentication type as **Individual Enrollment \[B\]**,     Authentication Method as **Certificates (X509) \[A\]**, and use the folder icons **\[D\]**, to upload the device primary and secondary certificates.

    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image14.png" style="width:4.42639in;height:4.82153in" />

## Provisioning a Device

Provisioning is a Device Management phase during which the Edge IoT
Device is configured with credentials to ensure that it can establish a
secure session with the Device Management backend. This usually involves
assigning Device ID’s and Secure tokens/keys which the Device may use to
identify and authenticate itself to the remote Device Management Portal.

### NOTE ON PREREQUISITE AND ASSUMPTIONS:

1.  The Intel® In-Band Manageability Framework is installed on the Edge
    IoT device.

2.  The date and time on the edge device needs to be set correct

3.  Device credentials (for example, Device ID, Scope ID, SAS token)
    that have been obtained from the Azure&reg; portal.

-   Launch the provisioning script using the command.

```shell
sudo provision-tc
```
    
-   If the device was previously provisioned, the following message appears. To override the previous cloud configuration, press **Y**.

```
A cloud configuration already exists: "Telit"
Replace configuration?
[Y/N] Y
```

-   Press **2** and **\[ENTER\]** for Azure&reg; to choose a cloud service.

```
Please choose a cloud service to use:

1) Telit Device Cloud 3) ThingsBoard
2) Azure IoT Central  4) Custom
#? 2
```

-   Next, enter the information for **Scope ID**, **Device ID**, and the
    **Shared Access Key**. Use the information collected in [Creating a Device and Obtaining Device Credentials](#creating-a-device-and-obtaining-device-credentials))**:**

```
Please enter the device scope ID:
dEviCeScopeID1234

Please enter the Device ID:
Device-ID-1234
```


-   Then, the user is required to select the authentication mechanism.

```
Please choose provision type.
1: SAS key authentication
2: X509 authentication
```

-   When the user selects 1: SAS key authentication, a prompt to enter SAS key is seen, the SAS key information can be obtained by
    following the steps in [Shared Access Signature (SAS) authentication](#shared-access-signature-(sas)-authentication):

```
Please enter the device SAS primary key (Hint: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/howto-generate-connection-string)
```

-   If the user selects 2: X509 authentication, the following prompt appears to confirm that the user has the device certificates generated.

```
Configuring device to use X509 auth requires device certificate verification.

Are device certs and keys generated? [Y/N]
```

-   If the user selects ‘**N**’, the provisioning exists stating that
    the device certificates are required to proceed further.

-   If the device certificates are already generated, select ‘**Y**’ and
    the user is requested to upload the certificates.

```
Please enter a filename to import
Input path to Device certificate file (*)
```

-   The user would be required to enter the path to the device key file:

```
Input Device Key from file? [Y/N] y

Please enter a filename to import
Input path to Device Key file (*key.pem):
/home/certs/device_key.pem
```


-   Once the information is provided by the user and if the cloud provisioning is successful, the following message appears.

```
Successfully configured cloud service!
```

-   A Yes/No user prompt appears requesting for a certificate verification on an OTA package. Choose **‘Y’** if FOTA or Config load packages need to be verified using signature, else choose **‘N’**.

```
Signature checks on OTA packages cannot not be validated without provisioning a cert file. Do you wish to use a pre-provisioned cert file for signature checks for OTA packages? [Y/N]
```

-   The script will then start the INB services; when the script
    finishes, the device should be able to interact with its associated
    IoT Central Application. To verify whether the device is provisioned
    to the right device on the Azure&reg; portal, check the status of the
    device created in section [Creating a Device and Obtaining Device Credentials](#creating-a-device-and-obtaining-device-credentials)
-   The device will be shown as ‘Provisioned’ on the top-right corner. Refer
    to [Using the IoT Central Application](#using-the-iot-central-application)

-   To verify the connectivity,

    1. Check to see if telemetry or events appear; refer
    [Using the IoT Central Application](#using-the-iot-central-application)

    2. Alternatively, trigger a command like Reboot; see
    [Using the IoT Central Application](#using-the-iot-central-application)


-   If at any time the cloud service configuration needs to be changed or updated, run the provisioning script again.

### Provisioning Command Parameters

Provisioning can be done with or without TPM security by setting
`PROVISION_TPM`. `PROVISION_TPM` can be set to:

-   `auto`: use TPM if present; disable if not present; do not prompt.

-   `disable`: do not use TPM.

-   `enable`: use TPM; return error code if TPM not detected.

-   (unset): default behavior; use TPM if present, prompt if not.

To run provisioning that automatically detecting the present of the TPM
security:

```shell
sudo PROVISION_TPM=auto provision-tc
```

To run without the TPM security:
```shell
sudo PROVISION_TPM=disable provision-tc
```

    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - Azure/media/image33.png" style="width:5.37569in;height:1.40556in" />

## OTA Updates

After the Intel® In-Band Manageability Framework running on the Edge IoT
Device is provisioned, it will establish a secure session with the
Azure&reg; portal and the status of the device can is visible as
‘Provisioned’ – refer to [Navigating the Device Interface](#navigating-the-device-interface).

Users shall be able to perform the updates listed below on the device
that is provisioned:

- AOTA (Application Over the Air update)

- FOTA (Firmware-over-the-Air update)

- SOTA (Software/OS-over-the-Air update)
- POTA (Platform-over-the Air update)

- Config Update (configuration parameter update)

- Power Management (Remote Shutdown and Restart)

### Trusted Repositories 

As part of a security measure, In-band Manageability requires the Server
URL(location) of the OTA update repository be included in a “trusted
repository list”, which is maintained internally. Hence, it is mandatory
that the OTA URL be included in the “trusted repository list” prior to
initiating an OTA command. This can be achieved via OTA configuration
Append command to add a new Server URL the existing Trusted Repository
list.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** It is critical for the user to ensure that the OTA
packages are hosted in secure repositories. This is outside the scope of
INBM.

OTA Configuration Update: refer to **[Configuration Append](#configuration-append)** for
adding the Server URL in the trustedRepositories via ‘Trigger Config
Update’.

**NOTE:** If the URL from which the package for an OTA update is being
fetched doesn’t exist in the trustedRepositories list, INB would abort
the update since the fetch URL is not in the trusted list.

### Preparing OTA Update Packages

Before updates can be dispatched to the endpoint, some preparation needs
to be done at the repository server to facilitate the updates.

#### Creating FOTA Package

The FOTA package structure remains the same when signature is used. For
a more secure FOTA update, users can provision a device with a PEM file
containing the signing certificate to validate the downloaded file
against a signature provided as part of the OTA command, refer [How to Generate Signature](#how-to-generate-signature) to generate signature. Users may create a PEM file
using the OpenSSL and Cryptography libraries.

**With Signature:** 
-   FOTA package structure with signature accepts a
    `tar` (archive) file or just a binary file as a FW update package.
    If using a `tar` file, the `tar` file should consist of the firmware
    update binary (e.g., `*.bin`, `*.cap`, and so on) file as a capsule.
    Archiving the `*.bin` file with a `tar` archive tool can be performed
    with the below command:

```shell
tar cvf ifwi_update.tar ifwi_update.bin
```

-   When a device is provisioned with a PEM file to check the signature, the
    expectation is that every FOTA method triggered with a firmware package
    is validated against the signature using the provisioned PEM file.

**Note**
> When using the secure method, do ensure to send the signature generated for the \*.tar file. Refer [How to Generate Signature](#how-to-generate-signature)

**Without Signature:** 
-   FOTA package structure without signature only
    accepts a single firmware update binary (e.g., `*.bin`, `*.cap`, and
    so on) file as a capsule.

#### Creating SOTA Package

SOTA on Ubuntu Operating System does not require any SOTA package.

SOTA on Yocto is handled by INB based on OS implementation:

1.  Debian package manager: in does not require any SOTA package
    creation but instead requires the APT repositories set correctly and
    path included in the apt resources.

2.  Mender.io: These involve OS update images, also known as **mender
    artifacts**, generated by the build infrastructure. More information
    on mender integration can be found at <https://docs.mender.io> .

AOTA Package structure for the below commands should follow the below
format

#### Creating Configuration Load Package

The Configuration load package structure remains unchanged when
signature field is used. For a more secure OTA update, users can
provision a device with a PEM file containing the certificate to
validate the downloaded file against a signature provided as part of the
OTA command, refer to [How to Generate Signature](#how-to-generate-signature).
Users may create a PEM file using the OpenSSL and Cryptography libraries.

1. **With Signature**: Configuration Load package structure with
    signature accepts both `tar` file with the
    `intel_manageability.conf` file and just the
    `intel_manageability.conf` file alone. Archiving the
    `intel_manageability.conf` file with a `tar` archive tool can be
    performed with below command:

When a device is provisioned with a PEM file to validate the downloaded
config file or package, it is expected that every Config Load method
triggered with a firmware package will be having a signature that is
validated against the signature using the provisioned PEM file.

1. **Without Signature**: Configuration Load package structure with no
    signature only contains `intel_manageability.conf` file

### How to Generate Signature

To generate certificate, private key and signatures, OpenSSL or
Cryptography libraries can be used.

Once the above are generated, to validate the OTA package for
FOTA/Config Load, we need to have the device provisioned with a
certificate (cert.pem). While triggering OTA command from cloud fill the
signature field in the OTA form before clicking ‘Execute’ to trigger
OTA.

1. While creating a signature INB, use shar-256 or sha-384 based
    encryption mechanism. <span class="underline"> </span>

## Telemetry Data

The Intel® In-Band Manageability provides two types of telemetry data,
static telemetry and dynamic telemetry. The telemetry data will indicate
the health of each endpoint.
### Static Telemetry Data

This contains the following information and can be viewed under the
**Properties** tab for a selected *Device*.
-   BIOS-release-date
-   BIOS-vendor
-   BIOS-version
-   CPU-ID
-   OS-information
-   System-Manufacturer
-   System-Product-Name
-   Total-physical-memory
-   System-Product-Name
### Dynamic Telemetry Data
Each endpoint publishes the following Dynamic Telemetry Data in 5-minute
intervals.
-   Available-memory
-   Core-temp-Celsius
-   Percent-disk-used
-   System-cpu-percent
-   Container-stats(cpu-usage)

### Provisioning Unsuccessful or Device Not Connected to Cloud

If the provisioning script is struck while creating *symlinks* at the
end of provisioning or Device is not connected to the cloud, there is a
chance that other system services that are waiting might possibly
blocked the INB services from starting. In order to fix this issue,
follow the steps:

Check if bootup is complete or not using the command:

```shell
sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
```

If the boot-up isn’t complete, list all the jobs:

```shell
sudo systemctl list-jobs
```

Stop all the jobs that are under ‘waiting’ state:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop [job_unit_name]
```

And try provisioning the device again following the steps in [Provisioning a Device](#provisioning-a-device).
