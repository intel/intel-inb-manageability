## Introduction
### Purpose

This User Guide serves to provide the reader an overview on how to:

- Login and setup ThingsBoard&reg; Cloud Service

- Provision the Edge IoT device running In-Band Manageability
    Framework

- Perform OTA updates through ThingsBoard.

It also provides examples of the Web-UI configuration, reported
Telemetry from device and commands for performing OTA updates.

### Audience

This guide is intended for

- Independent BIOS Vendors providing Firmware Update packages to
    ensure FW update binary packaging.

- Independent Software Vendors (ISV) providing OS and Application
    update packages.

- System Integrators administrating devices running In-Band
    Manageability framework.

## ThingsBoard&reg; Overview

### Getting Started with ThingsBoard&reg;

Creating a ThingsBoard&reg; account and obtaining the connection tokens from
ThingsBoard&reg; is required for provisioning/enabling In-Band Manageability
Over-the-Air updates. For reference and quick setup, you will also need
to import INB`s ThingsBoard&reg; things definition. which will provide the
same UI interface described in this document to monitor the device and
perform OTA commands.

This section will walk through the setup steps:

- Accessing ThingsBoard&reg;

- Setting up ThingsBoard&reg; TLS

- Changing ThingsBoard&reg; Server Port

- Creating ThingsBoard&reg; Account

#### Accessing ThingsBoard&reg;

To set up a ThingsBoard&reg; installation, follow the steps below:

- If not done already, create a ThingsBoard&reg; installation through the
    following link:  
    [**https://thingsboard.io/docs/installation/**](https://thingsboard.io/docs/installation/)

    **Note:** 
    > For a sandbox environment, choose the `Community` edition

- In order to run a ThingsBoard&reg; server instance on the same device as
    Intel Manageability, see [**Changing ThingsBoard&reg; Server Port**](#changing-thingsboard-server-port)

#### Setting up ThingsBoard&reg; TLS

To allow for a secure TLS connection to be established between a device
with Intel Manageability and a self-hosted ThingsBoard&reg; server, some
configuration must be done to the server. Information on that process
can be found below, or at:
[**https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/mqtt-over-ssl/**](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/mqtt-over-ssl/)

1. Download the *server.keygen.sh* and *keygen.properties* files from
    the link above

2. Fill out the *keygen.properties* accordingly

    1. Change is the **DOMAIN\_SUFFIX** field, which should match the
        hostname of the ThingsBoard&reg; server

    2. Export both MQTT\_BIND\_PORT and MQTT\_SSL\_BIND\_PORT in the
        thingsboard.conf file

    3. Any other changes (e.g. the **SERVER\_\*\_PASSWORD** fields)
        should be noted

3. Run the *server.keygen.sh* file with root privileges

4. Copy the resulting *\*.jks* file to the ThingsBoard&reg; configuration
    directory

    1. This may be under: 
    ```
    /etc/thingsboard/conf/
    ```

5. The *\*.pub.pem* file will be needed later to provision Intel
    Manageability devices

#### Changing ThingsBoard&reg; Server Port

Because both ThingsBoard&reg; and the Intel Manageability framework use MQTT
protocol, it is necessary to change the ThingsBoard&reg; MQTT Broker port to
a different number for both to coexist on the same device.

To do this:

1. Locate and open the *thingsboard.yml* file

    1. On Yocto, this file is located in 
    ```
    /etc/thingsboard/conf/
    ```

2. Change the property **transport \> mqtt \> bind\_port** to any other
    number (e.g. 2883)

    1. This property should be under a section labeled: `Local MQTT
        transport parameters`

    2. Be sure to note the new port number, and enter it accordingly in
        the provisioning step

3. If the ThingsBoard&reg; service is currently running, restart it to apply
    the changes

For the Docker&reg; version of Thingsboard, change the binding for port 1883,
e.g. with 2883:

#### Creating a ThingsBoard&reg; Account

If not done already, a ThingsBoard&reg; account will need to be created by a
ThingsBoard&reg; System Administrator. Note that in order to provision
devices and set up the dashboard, an account with the privileges of a
`Tenant Administrator` is required:

1. Log into a system administrator account; the default system
    administrator account details can be found here:
    [**https://thingsboard.io/docs/samples/demo-account/\#system-administrator**](https://thingsboard.io/docs/samples/demo-account/#system-administrator)

2. Add a tenant by clicking on `Tenants`, then the plus button:  
    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image4.png" style="width:5.78125in;height:3.59762in" />

3. Fill out the form that appears accordingly, then click `Add`

4. The tenant should appear as a new entry; click the *Users* icon:  
    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image5.png" style="width:5.78125in;height:2.92708in" />

5. On the page that appears, click the big plus icon, and fill out the
    form accordingly

6. After clicking add, the new user should be presented with an
    activation link

7. Clicking on the activation link will lead to a page where the
    account password is set

8. The new user should now be able to sign in with the account`s
    associated email and password

### Adding a Device

1. Add a device by clicking on `Devices`, then the plus button:  
    <img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image6.png" style="width:5.48333in;height:2.94028in" />

2. The following window should appear; fill it out accordingly, then
    click `Add`.

<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image7.png" style="width:5.73333in;height:4.09653in" />

### Obtaining Device Credentials

1. Click the shield icon on the newly created menu entry:

<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image8.png" style="width:5.75in;height:3.04167in" />

1. Note the **Access Token** in the window that appears:  
<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image9.png" alt="P261L16#yIS1" style="width:2.61706in;height:2.35281in" />

### Creating a Device to Use X.509 Auth

#### Generating Device Keys and Certificates

Prior to having the device authentication done using X509 mechanism, it
is mandatory to have TLS set on the ThingsBoard&reg; server. Refer section
[**Setting up ThingsBoard&reg; TLS**](#setting-up-thingsboard-tls) on how to setup ThingsBoard&reg; TLS.

Once the TLS is set up on the server, the instructions on how to
generate a client-side certificate can be found in the following link:

<https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/certificates/>

- Enter and save the *keygen.properties* accordingly and download the
    *client.keygen.sh* script.

- Running the script will generate *.jks*, *.nopass.pem*, *.pub.pem*
    files.

- The *.nopass.pem* file is used during provisioning in [Provisioning a Device](#provisioning-a-device).

- The *.pub.pem* file content is used during the creation of a device
    on the ThingsBoard&reg; portal.

#### Enrolling Device Created with X509 Public Key

1. Once the device is added as shown in [**Adding a Device**](#adding-a-device), click the **shield** icon on the created device entry.

<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image10.png" style="width:5.78333in;height:3.025in" />

2. Select X.509 Certificate as the **Credentials type**.

<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image11.png" style="width:2.4375in;height:4.32292in" />

3. Copy and paste the content of the client public key generated in the
**RSA public key** field and click **Save**. 

### Provisioning a Device

**NOTE:**
> Prerequisite and assumptions: The Intel® In-Band Manageability Framework is installed on the Edge IoT device.

1. Launch the provisioning script using the command.
```shell
sudo provision-tc
```

2. If the device was previously provisioned, the following message
    appears. To override the previous cloud configuration, press **Y**:

```
A cloud configuration already exists: "Telit"
Replace configuration?
[Y/N] Y
```

3. A prompt appears to choose the cloud service; press **3** and
    **\[ENTER\]** for ThingsBoard:

```
Please choose a cloud service to use:
1) Telit Device Cloud 3) ThingsBoard
2) Azure IoT Central  4) Custom
#? 3
```

4. A prompt appears for the **IP address** and **Port** set up in
    section [Accessing ThingsBoard&reg;](#accessing-thingsboard)  
    
```
Please enter the Server IP:

127.0.0.1
```
> Note that the server port entry can be left empty to use the default port
```
Please enter the server port (default 1883):

8883
```

5. A prompt for **Device** **provision type** appears; select the type
    of device authentication preferred:
``` 
Please choose provision type:
1. Token Authentication
2. X509 Authentication
```

6. Choosing option **1. Token Authentication** requires user to enter
    the token. Refer [Obtaining Device Credentials](#obtaining-device-credentials)

7. Choosing option **2. X509 Authentication** requires user to have
    device certificate and key generated as mention in [Generating Device Keys and Certificates](#generating-device-keys-and-certificates).
    The file path of the file with extension *nopass.pem* is entered in
    the prompt.
```
Configuring device to use X509 auth requires device certificate verification.

Are device certs and keys generated?  [Y/N] Y

Input Device certificate from file? [Y/N] y

Please enter a filename to import 

Input path to Device certificate file (*nopass.pem):
/home/abc/device_cert_nopass.pem
```

8. If user selects Token based authentication in step 6, an option for
    TLS will appear; press **Y** if the server was configured in
    [**Setting up ThingsBoard&reg; TLS**](#setting-up-thingsboardreg-tls). Otherwise, press **N** and
    skip to step 11.
> If the user selects X509 authentication, it is mandatory to have TLS configured. By default, the application proceeds with the TLS configuration.

```
Configure TLS? [Y/N]
```

9. Choose an input method for the *\*.pub.pem* file. The `Absolute file
    path` option requires a path to the file that does not include
    wildcards like \~. The `Console input` option will ask for the file
    to be input into the console; note that all lines preceding a line
    break cannot be edited:
```
Configuring TLS.
Input ThingsBoard CA from file? [Y/N] y

Please enter a filename to import 

ThingsBoard CA file (*.pub.pem):

/home/abc/mqttserver.pub.pem
```

10. If the cloud provisioning is successful, the following message
    appears:
```
Successfully configured cloud service!
```

11. A Yes/No user prompt appears asking for a certificate verification
    on an OTA package. Choose `Y` if FOTA/Config load packages need to
    be verified using signature else choose `N`.
```
Signature checks on OTA packages cannot not be validated without provisioning a cert file.
Do you wish to use a pre-provisioned cert file for signature checks for OTA packages? [Y/N]
```

12. In-Band Manageability Framework Services are Enabled and Started.

    The script will then start the Intel Manageability services; when
    the script finishes, the device should be able to interact with the
    ThingsBoard&reg; dashboard; refer [Setting up the Dashboards](#setting-up-the-dashboards).

```

```

13. If at any time the cloud service configuration needs to be changed
    or updated, run the provisioning steps again.

**Note:** 
> If provisioning is unsuccessful, refer to **[Provisioning Unsuccessful](#provisioning-unsuccessful-or-device-not-connected-to-cloud)** for Troubleshooting.

#### Provisioning Command Parameters

Provisioning can be done with or without TPM security by setting
`PROVISION_TPM`. `PROVISION_TPM` can be set to:

-   `auto`: use TPM if present; disable if not present; do not prompt.

-   `disable`: do not use TPM.

-   `enable`: use TPM; return error code if TPM not detected.

-   (unset): default behavior; use TPM if present, prompt if not.

To run provisioning that automatically detecting the present of the TPM
security:

```shell
sudo PROVISION_TPM=auto provision-tc
```

To run without the TPM security:
```shell
sudo PROVISION_TPM=disable provision-tc
```

### Modifying and Working with Intel Manageability Widgets

ThingsBoard&reg; widgets are coded in HTML/CSS/JavaScript + AngularJS through
ThingsBoard`s built-in Widget IDE. They can then be added to dashboards
and exported for later use. Resources on how to edit and use the widgets
can be found below:

- [**Getting Started with
    AngularJS**](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/default.asp)

- [**About AngularJS
    Material**](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/)

- [**ThingsBoard&reg; Widgets Development
    Guide**](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/contribution/widgets-development/)

The Intel Manageability Widgets bundle consists of seven widgets:

- **Device Information**: Provides a well formatted device properties
    display

- **Connectivity Status**: Displays the device connectivity status

- **Dynamic Telemetry**: Extension of built-in time series display

- **Event Log**: Extension of built-in textual time series display

- **OTA Form**: Provides a flexible RPC request trigger with user
    input fields

- **Device List**: Provides a selection box for batch RPC calls

- **Docker&reg; Stats Widget**: Provides a human readable view of the
    latest Docker&reg; statistics

The Device Information is self-contained. However, the other widgets
communicate with each other through [**Custom JavaScript
Events**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events).
The relationships of the events are illustrated below:
<p align="center">
<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image18.png" alt="P377#yIS2" style="width:3.91895in;height:2.61563in" />
</p>

The Events allow for the widgets to overcome their single API
limitation:

- Connectivity Status is actually an RPC widget, hence it cannot
    access Time Series data. To overcome this, Dynamic Telemetry and
    Event Log widgets broadcast updates that Connectivity Status uses in
    its polling decisions.

- Device List is used to send a list of selected devices to OTA Form
    widgets for batch operations

## Commands

After the In-Band Manageability Framework running on the Edge IoT Device
is provisioned, it will establish a secure session with the ThingsBoard
portal and the status of the device can is visible as `Online` – refer
as seen below:

Users shall be able to perform the updates listed below on the device
that is provisioned:

- AOTA (Application Over the Air update)

- FOTA (Firmware-over-the-Air update)

- SOTA (Software/OS-over-the-Air update)

- Config Update (Configuration Parameter update)

- Query Command

- Power Management (Remote Shutdown and Restart)

### Trusted Repositories

As part of a security measure, In-band Manageability requires the Server
URL(location) of the OTA update repository be included in a `trusted
repository list`, which is maintained internally. Hence, it is mandatory
that the OTA URL be included in the `trusted repository list` prior to
initiating an OTA command. This can be achieved via OTA configuration
Append command to add a new Server URL the existing Trusted Repository
list.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** 
> It is critical for the user to ensure that the OTA packages are hosted in secure repositories. This is outside the scope of INBM.

**OTA Configuration Update:** refer to **[Configuration Append](#configuration-append)** for adding the Server URL in the trustedRepositories via `Trigger Config
Update`.

**NOTE:** 
> If the URL from which the package for an OTA update is being fetched doesn`t exist in the trustedRepositories list, INB would abort the update since the fetch URL is not in the trusted list.

### Preparing OTA Update Packages

Before updates can be dispatched to the endpoint, some preparation needs
to be done at the repository server to facilitate the updates.

#### Creating FOTA Package

The FOTA package structure remains the same when signature is used. For
a more secure FOTA update, users can provision a device with a PEM file
containing the signing certificate to validate the downloaded file
against a signature provided as part of the OTA command, refer [How to Generate Signature](#how-to-generate-signature) to generate signature. Users may create a PEM file
using the OpenSSL and Cryptography libraries.

**With Signature:** 
-   FOTA package structure with signature accepts a
    `tar` (archive) file or just a binary file as a FW update package.
    If using a `tar` file, the `tar` file should consist of the firmware
    update binary (e.g., `*.bin`, `*.cap`, and so on) file as a capsule.
    Archiving the `*.bin` file with a `tar` archive tool can be performed
    with the below command:

```shell
tar cvf ifwi_update.tar ifwi_update.bin
```

-   When a device is provisioned with a PEM file to check the signature, the
    expectation is that every FOTA method triggered with a firmware package
    is validated against the signature using the provisioned PEM file.

**Note**
> When using the secure method, do ensure to send the signature generated for the \*.tar file. Refer [How to Generate Signature](#how-to-generate-signature)
**Without Signature:** 
-   FOTA package structure without signature only
    accepts a single firmware update binary (e.g., `*.bin`, `*.cap`, and
    so on) file as a capsule.

#### Creating SOTA Package

SOTA on Ubuntu\* Operating System does not require any SOTA package.

SOTA on Yocto is handled by INB based on OS implementation:

1. Debian package manager: in does not require any SOTA package
    creation but instead requires the APT repositories set correctly and
    path included in the apt resources.

2. Mender.io: These involve OS update images, also known as **mender
    artifacts**, generated by the build infrastructure. More information
    on mender integration can be found at <https://docs.mender.io> .

#### Creating AOTA Package

AOTA Package structure for the below commands should follow the below
format

|AOTA Command|AOTA Package Structure|
|---|---|
|AOTA docker-compose package<br>(Same format for up/pull)|Container Tag == Container Image Name<br>Example: The container Image name and the tar file name should be the same<br>*Container Tag =* `CPU`<br>*Tar file =* `CPU.tar.gz`<br>*Note: The tar file should contain a folder with the same name `CPU`. This folder `CPU` needs to have the `docker-compose.yml` file.*<br>Steps:<br>1. Make a folder<br>2. Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file into the folder<br>Tar the folder|
|AOTA Docker&reg; Load/Import|Package needs to be `tar.gz` format<br>The package needs to have a folder within the same name as the package.|

#### Creating Configuration Load Package

The Configuration load package structure remains unchanged when
signature field is used. For a more secure OTA update, users can
provision a device with a PEM file containing the certificate to
validate the downloaded file against a signature provided as part of the
OTA command, refer  [How to Generate Signature](#how-to-generate-signature). Users may create a
PEM file using the OpenSSL and Cryptography libraries.

1. **With Signature**: Configuration Load package structure with
    signature accepts both *tar* file with the
    *intel\_manageability.conf* file and just the
    *intel\_manageability.conf* file alone. Archiving the
    *intel\_manageability.conf* file with a *tar* archive tool can be
    performed with below command:
```shell
tar cvf conf_update.tar intel_manageability.conf signing_cert.pem
```

-   When a device is provisioned with a PEM file to validate the downloaded
    config file or package, it is expected that every Config Load method
    triggered with a firmware package will be having a signature that is
    validated against the signature using the provisioned PEM file.

2. **Without Signature**: Configuration Load package structure with no
    signature only contains *intel\_manageability.conf* file

### How to Generate Signature

To generate certificate, private key and signatures, OpenSSL or
Cryptography libraries can be used.

Once the above are generated, to validate the OTA package for
FOTA/Config Load, we need to have the device provisioned with a
certificate (cert.pem). While triggering OTA command from cloud fill the
signature field in the OTA form before clicking `Execute` to trigger
OTA.
**NOTE:**
> While creating a signature INB, use shar-256 or sha-384 based encryption mechanism.

### OTA Updates

To trigger Over the Air (OTA) updates, Device Status should be online as
seen in [**Interacting with Multiple Devices**](#interacting-with-multiple-devices). Go to
**DashBoards** tab and select the correct **DashBoard\[1\]** and under
entities, select your **Edge Device\[2\]** and click any **OTA
buttons\[3\]** as seen below

<img src="media/In-Band Manageability User Guide - ThingsBoard/media/image19.png"/>
