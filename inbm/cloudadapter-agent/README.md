## Overview

- The Intel Manageability agent that publishes and subscribes to a chosen cloud service.
- The agent will pipeline remote procedure calls to corresponding agents.
- It will also pipeline telemetry and event data to the cloud service.

## Agent Communication

### Cloud Services

The agent supports MQTT for communication with cloud services.

There are two supported cloud services:
  - [Azure IoT Central](../../docs/In-Band%20Manageability%20User%20Guide%20-%20Azure.md)
  - [ThingsBoard](../../docs/In-Band%20Manageability%20User%20Guide%20-%20ThingsBoard.md)

### Intel Manageability

The agent uses MQTT for communication with other agents.

#### Publish channels
The agent publishes to the following topics:
  - cloudadapter-agent state: `cloudadapter/state` when dead/running
  - Manifest install requests: `manageability/request/`

#### Subscribe channels
The agent subscribes to the following topics:
  - Agent states: `+/state`
  - Agent events: `manageability/event`
  - Responses: `manageability/response`
  - Device telemetry: `manageability/telemetry`

❗`+` is a wild-card indicating single level thus matching `diagnostic/state` or `<another-agent>/state`

Events or responses sent to the agent are logged or published to the cloud as-is.

Device telemetry sent to the agent should have the following schema:
```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["type", "values"],
    "properties": {
        "type": {
            "description": "Type of telemetry",
            "type": "string",
            "enum": [
                "dynamic_telemetry",
                "static_telemetry"
            ]
        },
        "values": {
            "description": "Key value mapping of the telemetry",
            "type": "object",
            "patternProperties": {
                ".+": { "type": "string" }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
For example:
```json
{
    "type": "dynamic_telementry",
    "values": {
        "availableMemory": "2048",
        "systemCpuPercent": "25"
    }
}
```

## Install from Source
❗ Use a Python version greater than 3.8 is installed

- [Build INBM](#../../README.md#build-instructions)
- [Install INBM](#../../docs/In-Band%20Manageability%20Installation%20Guide%20Ubuntu.md)

## Usage
❗Ensure Mosquitto broker is installed and configured for Intel(R) In-Band Manageability.  
❗Some commands will require root privileges (sudo)  
❗Run commands in the `inbm/cloudadapter-agent` directory


### Setup:
- Run: `make config`
- Refer to the following documents for cloud setup:
  - [Azure](#../../docs/In-Band%20Manageability%20User%20Guide%20-%20Azure.md)
  - [Thingsboard](#../../docs/In-Band%20Manageability%20User%20Guide%20-%20ThingsBoard.md)

### Changing the logging level:

- Run: `make logging LEVEL=DEBUG`
- Valid values for `LEVEL`:
  - `DEBUG`
  - `ERROR`
  - `INFO`

### Run the agent:

- Run: `make run`

### Test the agent:

- Run: `make tests`

## Debian package (DEB)

### Install (For Ubuntu)
After building the above package, if you only want to install the cloudadpater-agent, you can do so by following these steps:
- `cd dist/inbm`
- Unzip package: `sudo tar -xvf Intel-Manageability.preview.tar.gz`
- Install package: `dpkg -i cloudadapter-agent<latest>.deb`

### Uninstall (For Ubuntu)
- `dpkg --purge cloudadapter-agent`
