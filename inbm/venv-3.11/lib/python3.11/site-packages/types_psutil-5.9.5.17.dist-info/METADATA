## Typing stubs for psutil

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`psutil`](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`psutil`.

This version of `types-psutil` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `psutil==5.9.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/psutil. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `cb688d2577520d98c09853acc20de099300b4e48` and was tested
with mypy 1.5.1, pyright 1.1.330, and
pytype 2023.10.5.
