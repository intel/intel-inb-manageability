## Overview

The Intel Manageability agent which manages SOC registration and facilitates OTA updates on HDDL devices.

## Agent Communication 

Uses MQTT for communication with INBC and Dispatcher-agent.

### Publish Channels
The agent publishes to the following topics:
  - Telemetry events: `manageability/event`
  - Telemetry data: `manageability/telemetry`
  - Command results: `manageability/response`
  - vision-agent state: vision/state` when dead/running

### Subscribe Channels
The agent subscribes to the following topics:
  - Incoming requests from the cloud or INBC: `ma/request/+`
  - Updates to configuration values in either vision-agent, node-agent, or INB residing on the SOC: `ma/configuration/update/+`
  - Agent states: `+/state`

 P.S: `+` is a wild-card indicating single level thus matching `node/state` or `<another-agent>/state`

## Commands supported

### Channel `ma/request/+`
- `install` - FOTA/SOTA/POTA update requests

### Channel `ma/configuration/update/+`
- `get-element` - gets element at the given path.
- `set_element` - sets element at the given path with the given value.
- `load` - load a new configuration file
- `append` - append to a value at the given path with the given value.file
- `remove` - remove the given value at the given path.
