## Overview

The Intel Manageability agent which registers with the Vision Agent and facilitates updates on the SOC.

## Agent Communication 

Uses MQTT for communication with the Dispatcher-agent residing on the SOC.

### Publish Channels
The agent publishes to the following topics:
  - Request from cloud or INBC for the node: `manageability/request/install`
  - node-agent state: node/state` when dead/running

### Subscribe Channels
The agent subscribes to the following topics:
 - Events to be sent back to the user: `manageability/event` 
 - Telemetry data: `manageability/telemetry`
 - Update response: `manageability/response`
 - Configuration response: `configuration/response`
 - Agent states: `+/state`

 P.S: `+` is a wild-card indicating single level thus matching `node/state` or `<another-agent>/state`

## Install from Source
The node-agent is installed on a Yocto image, which requires flashing a Mender image that contains the Node-agent.
